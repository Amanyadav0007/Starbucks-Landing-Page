# Starbucks-Landing-Page
A stunning and responsive Starbucks landing page built from scratch using HTML and CSS! 💻🎨

Hello everyone! 👋 As a passionate web developer, I recently took on an exciting project to design and build a Starbucks landing page from scratch using core HTML and CSS. I am thrilled to share the results with you all today!

📱 Fully Responsive Design:
One of the primary goals of this project was to ensure that the landing page looks fantastic and functions flawlessly on both mobile and desktop devices. Leveraging the power of media queries and responsive design techniques, I've crafted a seamless browsing experience for users across various screen sizes.

✨ Catchy Hover Effects:
To add a touch of interactivity and make the page engaging, I've implemented captivating hover effects on buttons and navigation elements. When users hover over buttons, they are treated to eye-catching animations that enhance the overall user experience.

🎨 Thoughtful Design Choices:
The design of the Starbucks landing page was thoughtfully crafted, staying true to the brand's aesthetics while infusing it with modern elements to keep it fresh and appealing. From color choices to typography, every aspect was carefully considered to create a visually striking presentation.

🚀 Core HTML and CSS:
I opted to build this landing page using core HTML and CSS, without relying on any third-party frameworks. This decision allowed me to have complete control over the code and optimize the page's performance for faster loading times.

🛠️ Technology Stack:

HTML: To structure the content and layout.
CSS: For styling and responsiveness.
Media Queries: To ensure a seamless user experience across different devices.
Hover Effects: I try to make a normal hover effect on button and navbar elements.
